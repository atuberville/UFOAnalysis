# UFO Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to take all UFO data that was collected and create an interactive
website in order to combine the information into an easy to filter table.

## How to search
1. Identify how you would like to search through the data


2. Locate the Filter Search Bar on the website

3. Enter the date, cite, state, country, or shape you would like to search by

4. Hit 'Enter' on your keyboard to update the data to the right of the webpage

## Improvements
One drawback of the webpage is that the data set would be difficult to update with additional data from additional .js files. Additionally, the introduction paragraph is blocked in and could be formatted so the table is easier to view when you first open the webpage instead of having to scroll. 
## Recommendations for development
1. I would recommend drop down menus since 'shape' is a broad search term and you could potentially not return anything because of a typo or search for something that doesn't exist.
2. I would suggest finding a way to clean the data prior to importing into the website. There are several special characters that are not formatted correctly, and the city, state, and country items are not properly capitalized.
